# Advanced Mathematical Physics A (2025)

## Exam dates

- We need to choose one day for written and one day for oral part (although if you manage to solve everything during the written part, you will not need to come for the oral one).

- The maximal possible exam duration will be 4.5 hours, for example from 9:30 till 14:00, although 3.5 hours should be sufficient.

### My restrictions

- I will move to Birmingham (UK) from January 2026. Therefore, I will probably be able to come back just once or twice to organise the exam; all other exams will be organised by someone else (although I will take part in it by preparing problems, and will probably be able to connect online).

- I'm moving to Birmingham on 5 January 2026.

- After I move, I will need to settle (at least to find an apartment) – I will not be able to move before that. I will notify you when something changes.

- My teaching schedule for the online course in Birmingham looks as follows (Trieste time):

| Tue (11:00-12:00) | Thu (13:00-14:00) | Lectures |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 27 January        | 29 January        | 01, 02   |
| 3 February        | 5 February        | 03, 04   |
| 10 February       | 12 February       | 05, 06   |
| 17 February       | 19 February       | 07, 08   |
| 24 February       | 26 February       | 09, 10   |
| 3 March           | 5 March           | 11, 12   |
| 10 March          | 12 March          | 13, 14   |
| 17 March          | 19 March          | 15, 16   |
| 24 March          | 26 March          | 17, 18   |
| 31 March          | 2 April           | 19, 20   |

My other activity is a seminar on Tuesdays, 15:00-16:30, starting on 20 January.

### Potential dates

- If I manage to settle really quickly, and there is still some time before 27 January, maybe it's better to organise the first exam in this period (**something like 22-23 January**). **I will tell you later is this is an option.**

- If all these UK things take longer, I will start teaching and would need to see how it goes. For this reason, the next availability window is **from mid-February till the early April**. It is not very convenient, because I will need to combine the exam with the online teaching, but I also remember that some of you cannot pass it later.

- The most convenient period for me starts **from early April**. As you may know, University of Trieste allows multiple attempts to pass the exam. If we agree on this, I can also come one more time during that period.

### Proposed dates

- Adriano Baldolini told me that he was planning exam dates with other students. You might also want to coordinate with him.
