# Advanced Mathematical Physics A (2025)

## Exam dates

- We need to choose one day for the written and one day for the oral part (although if you manage to solve everything during the written part, you will not need to come for the oral one).

- The maximal possible exam duration will be 4.5 hours, for example from 9:30 till 14:00 (or some other time), although 3.5 hours should be sufficient.

### My restrictions

- I've already moved to Birmingham, found an apartment, and hope to settle soon.

- I will have online teaching on Tuesdays (11:00-12:00) and Thursdays (13:00-14:00). I can teach from Trieste (maybe even in the middle of a written exam).

- I will have offline seminars on Tuesdays starting from 20 January.

- There will be other offline events on different days. They are labelled with "*" in the table below.

- I don't want to go anywhere during the first weeks of teaching.

- I need to fly to Trieste one day before the exam.

All these restrictions can be summarised in the following table, leaving essentially some Thursdays and Fridays:

|          | 7 April *         |          | 9 April *         |                     |
|          | 14 April *        |          |                   | 16, 17 April        |

|          | 28 April *        |          |                   | ...                 |

Of course, further obstacles can appear later, excluding some other days. This is why I haven't marked the other days with bold – anything can change.

### Potential dates

- I would prefer to organise the first exam on 22 and 23 January; it is more convenient for many reasons.

- If it is too inconvenient for many of you, we can try to find other days. (5 and 6 February are inconvenient for me, as it makes the schedule too dense.)

- Future exams will be organised by other people. If you prefer, I could try to come to Trieste again later.

- Adriano Baldolini told me that he was planning exam dates with other students. You might also want to coordinate with him.
