# Advanced Mathematical Physics A (2025)

## Exam

- It is enough to solve 5 problems to get the maximal result.
- To get 30 cl, you should solve 6.5 problems.
- If you solve less than 5 problems, the grade is counted as number of solved problems * 6.
- If your grade is insufficient for 'pass', or you are not satisfied with it, you will need to come to the oral part of exam to answer some questions and solve extra problems.
- You have 4.5 hours.
- If you manage to finish sufficiently earlier than the deadline, you may ask the examiner to check your solutions quickly and tell you which of them contain mistakes (but not what these mistakes are or where they are localised).
