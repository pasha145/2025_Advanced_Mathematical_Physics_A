## Info about the exam

I will move to Birmingham from January 2026. Therefore, I will probably be able to come back just once to organise the exam; all other exams will be organised by someone else (although I will take part in it by preparing problems, and will probably be able to connect online).

As for the structure of the exam: it will consist of written and oral parts. The main idea is that you should be able to solve equations. Therefore, if you manage to solve all problems except a few during the written part, you will not need to come for the oral one. Otherwise, you will need to come and answer some extra questions. As for the problems â€“ they will be similar to those I will write during the semester.
